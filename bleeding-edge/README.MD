# Release Notes

siginificant optimization for 'A' courses : fall and winter concurrent than sequential, but no early return checks yet (more visible in uneven distribution).

not specifing session in courses implies 'A'.

optimized state by decreasing containers used and made num_crcs and async_crcs global, given restricted use, increasing cloner speed.

made cloner function global.

lecture address now point to lec data in a dictionary, improving deletion complexity.
